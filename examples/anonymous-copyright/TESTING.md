## Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (mock network)
npm run test

# Run main test file only
npm run test:main

# Run with gas reporting
npm run test:gas

# Run with coverage analysis
npm run test:coverage
npm run coverage

# Run Sepolia tests (requires deployment)
npm run test:sepolia
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Contract deploys with valid address
- ✅ Deployer is set as owner
- ✅ Work counter initializes to zero
- ✅ Total works count starts at zero
- ✅ Contract address is accessible

**Example:**
```javascript
it("should deploy successfully with valid address", async function () {
  expect(contractAddress).to.be.properAddress;
  expect(contractAddress).to.not.equal(ethers.ZeroAddress);

- ✅ Different author IDs handled
- ✅ Non-registered check returns false
- ✅ Separate author profiles maintained

**Example:**
```javascript
it("should allow user to register as author", async function () {
  const tx = await contract.connect(alice).registerAuthor(authorId);
  await tx.wait();

  const isRegistered = await contract.isRegisteredAuthor(alice.address);

**Example:**
```javascript
it("should allow registered author to register work", async function () {
  const tx = await contract.connect(alice).registerWork(
    contentHash,

## Writing New Tests

### Test Template

```javascript
describe("New Feature", function () {
  beforeEach(async function () {
    // Setup before each test
    const deployment = await deployFixture();
    contract = deployment.contract;
    // ... other setup
  });

  describe("Feature Category", function () {
    it("should do something specific", async function () {
      // Arrange
      const input = "test data";

      // Act
      const tx = await contract.someFunction(input);
      await tx.wait();

      // Assert
      const result = await contract.getResult();
      expect(result).to.equal(expectedValue);
    });

    it("should reject invalid input", async function () {
      // Test error conditions
      await expect(
        contract.someFunction(invalidInput)
      ).to.be.revertedWith("Error message");
    });
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Test Names**:
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good
   it("should reject work registration from non-registered author")

   // ❌ Bad
   it("test1")
   ```

2. **Follow AAA Pattern**:
   - **Arrange**: Set up test data
   - **Act**: Execute function
   - **Assert**: Verify results

3. **Test One Thing Per Test**:
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good
   it("should increment work counter", async function () {
     await contract.registerWork(...);
     expect(await contract.getTotalWorks()).to.equal(1);
   });

   // ❌ Bad - testing multiple things
   it("should work", async function () {
     await contract.registerWork(...);
     expect(await contract.getTotalWorks()).to.equal(1);
     expect(await contract.owner()).to.equal(owner.address);
     // ... many more assertions
   });
   ```

4. **Use beforeEach for Common Setup**:
   ```javascript
   beforeEach(async function () {
     // Common setup code
     await contract.connect(alice).registerAuthor(100001);
   });
   ```

5. **Clean Error Messages**:
   ```javascript
   expect(result).to.equal(
     expected,
     `Expected ${expected} but got ${result}`
   );
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Contract not deployed"

**Error**:
```
Error: No Sepolia deployment found!
```

**Solution**:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### 2. "Insufficient funds"

**Error**:
```
Error: sender doesn't have enough funds
```

**Solution**:
- Get Sepolia ETH from faucets
- Check balance: `npm run accounts`

#### 3. "Test timeout"

**Error**:
```
Error: Timeout of 2000ms exceeded
```

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Increase timeout in test
it("slow test", async function () {
  this.timeout(60000); // 60 seconds
  // ... test code
});
```

#### 4. "Invalid opcode" or "Revert"

**Solution**:
- Check contract was compiled: `npm run compile`
- Verify function parameters
- Review error messages in contract

#### 5. "Network connection failed"

**Error**:
```
Error: could not detect network
```

**Solution**:
- Check SEPOLIA_RPC_URL in .env
- Try alternative RPC
- Check internet connection

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests with Hardhat debug logging
npx hardhat test --verbose

# Show stack traces
npx hardhat test --show-stack-traces
```

### Clean Build

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run compile
npm test
```
