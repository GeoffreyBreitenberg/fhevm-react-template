# 🔐 Anonymous Copyright Protection

A privacy-preserving blockchain platform for creative work authentication using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## 🌟 Overview

Anonymous Copyright Protection leverages **fhEVM** (Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Ethereum Virtual Machine) to enable creators to register and protect their original works without revealing sensitive information on-chain. All content hashes and author identities remain encrypted while still being verifiable and disputable.

## 🎯 Core Concept

### Privacy-Preserving Original Work Authentication

Traditional copyright registration systems expose creator identities and work details publicly. Our solution uses **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** to:

- **Encrypt Author Identity**: Register with a secret author ID that remains private on the blockchain
- **Encrypt Content Hash**: Submit work fingerprints that are encrypted yet verifiable
- **Private Verification**: Verify ownership without revealing the original hash
- **Encrypted Disputes**: Challenge works with encrypted evidence
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove ownership without exposing sensitive data

## 📋 Features

### 1. Anonymous Author Registration
- Register with an encrypted numeric author ID
- Identity remains private on-chain
- One-time registration per address

### 2. Encrypted Work Registration
- Submit creative works with encrypted content hashes
- Public metadata: title, category, timestamp
- Private data: content hash, author ID (both encrypted)
- Permanent on-chain record

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Verification
- Verify work ownership without revealing original hash
- Asynchronous FHE decryption process
- Results emitted via blockchain events

### 4. Dispute Resolution System
- File disputes with encrypted evidence
- Compare encrypted hashes on-chain
- Transparent resolution process

### 5. Work Categories
- Literature
- Music
- Art
- Photography
- Software
- Design
- Video
- Other

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
contract AnonymousCopyright {
    // Encrypted data structures
    struct OriginalWork {
        euint32 encryptedContentHash;  // FHE encrypted hash
        euint64 encryptedAuthorId;     // FHE encrypted ID
        address registrant;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bool verified;
        bool disputed;
        string workTitle;
        string category;
    }

    struct AuthorProfile {
        euint64 encryptedAuthorId;     // Private identity
        bool registered;
        uint256 workCount;
        uint256 totalDisputes;
        uint256 wonDisputes;
    }
}
```

### Key Functions

1. **registerAuthor(uint64 _authorId)**

2. **registerWork(uint32 _contentHash, string _title, string _category)**
   - Encrypts content hash
   - Links to encrypted author ID
   - Returns unique work ID

3. **requestVerifyWork(uint256 _workId, uint32 _contentHashToVerify)**
   - Initiates encrypted comparison
   - Async decryption via fhEVM gateway
   - Results via VerificationResult event

4. **fileDispute(uint256 _workId, uint32 _challengerContentHash)**
   - Submit encrypted challenge
   - Transparent dispute record

5. **resolveDispute(uint256 _workId, uint256 _disputeId)**
   - Compare encrypted hashes
   - Determine rightful owner
